# Gustavo Martin Alvarez
Hi, my name is Gustavo
I am a Information Systems Engineering student at UTN FRD.
I am also AWS Certified Develope

Since 2022, I have been learning web development programming. My current goal is to be able to conceptualize, design, and create high-quality software products.
I am a firm believer in quality over quantity.

Therefore, in this README, I will only present my most relevant projects
## Projects

- **Payroll Integration PoC - Azure Functions**: https://github.com/gustipardo/payroll-integration-poc
I developed a payroll integration PoC using Azure Functions to expose REST endpoints, with overtime calculation logic and approval flow. CI/CD pipeline configured in GitHub Actions (build → tests → deploy).


- **Laccei Group Website:**

Live Demo: https://pagina-web-blush-seven.vercel.app/
I contributed to the creation of the official landing page for Laccei, a faculty group from my university. This project was particularly meaningful as it helped me stay connected with my academic community during my gap year in New Zealand. It utilized Astro, incorporated Lucide icons, and its design was initially crafted in Figma. This was a collaborative effort with Magali Acosta and Jose Pablo Garcia.

- **Distribuidora Pinto:** https://distro-pinto-app.vercel.app/facturas
repo: https://github.com/gustipardo/distro-pinto
A digital solution for a food distribution company. For this, I took on a systems analyst role, examining their invoicing and collections processes to identify problems and design appropriate solutions. This solution consists of a web application with a React frontend, designed in Figma, utilizing Shadcn components and Zustand for state management. The API is built with Express in an MVC architecture, and the database uses SQLite3. The project can be developed with a local SQLite3 database and then deployed to a production environment with Turso.

- **Week Task Manager:** https://github.com/gustipardo/Week-task-manager

  A project to track the weekly activities that one sets out to add to their routine, a method used by me.

- **Caelis Chaos:** https://caelischaos.vercel.app/

  A blog for a gaming company that serves as a presentation letter and a method to connect and keep the community informed.

- **DSI:** https://www.dsiconstructora.ar/
  
  Landing page for a construction company located in Argentina. Company presentation, showcase of completed works, and contact information.
