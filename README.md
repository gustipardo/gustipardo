# Gustavo Martin Alvarez
Hi, my name is Gustavo
I am a Information Systems Engineering student at UTN FRD.
I am also an electromechanical technician.

Since 2022, I have been learning web development programming. My current goal is to be able to conceptualize, design, and create high-quality software products.
I am a firm believer in quality over quantity.

Therefore, in this README, I will only present my most relevant projects
## Projects
  **Distribuidora Pinto: ** https://distro-pinto-app.vercel.app/facturas
A digital solution for a food distribution company. For this, I took on a systems analyst role, examining their invoicing and collections processes to identify problems and design appropriate solutions. This solution consists of a web application with a React frontend, designed in Figma, utilizing Shadcn components and Zustand for state management. The API is built with Express in an MVC architecture, and the database uses SQLite3. The project can be developed with a local SQLite3 database and then deployed to a production environment with Turso.
